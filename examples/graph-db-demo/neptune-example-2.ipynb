Your experience trying it in Mumbai during your business trip last year must have been authentic. Mumbai has some excellent restaurants serving regional cuisines from across India. Did you get to try any other local specialties during your visit? Many travelers find that the food in India varies dramatically from region to region.\"}]\n",
